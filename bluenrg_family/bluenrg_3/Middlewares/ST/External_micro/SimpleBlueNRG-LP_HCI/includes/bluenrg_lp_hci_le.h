 *        parameter has been configured for periodic advertising using the
 *        LE_Set_Periodic_Advertising_Parameters Command (see Section 7.8.61),
 *        regardless of whether advertising in that set is enabled or disabled.
 *        If the advertising set has not been configured for periodic
 *        advertising, then the Controller shall return the error code Command
 *        Disallowed (0x0C). If advertising is currently enabled for the
 *        specified advertising set, the Controller shall use the new data in
 *        subsequent periodic advertising events for this advertising set. If a
 *        periodic advertising event is in progress when this command is issued,
 *        the Controller may use the old or new data for that event. If periodic
 *        advertising is currently disabled for the specified advertising set,
 *        the data shall be kept by the Controller and used once periodic

 *        HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Report events for this periodic
 *        advertising train are initially enabled or disabled, and whether
 *        duplicate reports are filtered or not. If the Periodic Advertiser List
 *        is not used, the Advertising_SID, Advertiser Address_Type, and
 *        Advertiser Address parameters specify the periodic advertising device
 *        to listen to; otherwise they shall be ignored. The Advertising_SID
 *        parameter, if used, specifies the value that must match the
 *        Advertising SID subfield in the ADI field of the received
 *        advertisement for it to be used to synchronize. The Skip parameter
 *        specifies the maximum number of consecutive periodic advertising
 *        events that the receiver may skip after successfully receiving a
 *        periodic advertising packet. The Sync_Timeout parameter specifies the
 *        maximum permitted time between successful receives. If this time is
 *        exceeded, synchronization is lost. The Sync_CTE_Type parameter
 *        specifies whether to only synchronize to periodic advertising with
 *        certain types of Constant Tone Extension (a value of 0 indicates that
 *        the presence or absence of a Constant Tone Extension is irrelevant).
 *        If the periodic advertising has the wrong type of Constant Tone
 *        Extension then: - If bit 0 of Options is set, the Controller shall
 *        ignore this address and SID and continue to search for other periodic
 *        advertisements. - Otherwise, the Controller shall cancel the
 *        synchronization with the error code Unsupported Remote Feature (0x1A).
 *        If the periodic advertiser changes the type of Constant Tone Extension
 *        after the scanner has synchronized with the periodic advertising, the
 *        scanner's Link Layer shall remain synchronized. If the Host sets all
 *        the non-reserved bits of the Sync_CTE_Type parameter to 1, the
 *        Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *        Irrespective of the value of the Skip parameter, the Controller should
 *        stop skipping packets before the Sync_Timeout would be exceeded. If
 *        the Host issues this command when another
 *        HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_- Create_Sync command is pending, the
 *        Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). If
 *        the Host issues this command with bit 0 of Options not set and with
 *        Advertising_SID, Advertiser_Address_Type, and Advertiser_Address the
 *        same as those of a periodic advertising train that the Controller is
 *        already synchronized to, the Controller shall return the error code
 *        Connection Already Exists (0x0B). If the Host issues this command and
 *        the Controller has insufficient resources to handle any more periodic
 *        advertising trains, the Controller shall return the error code Memory
 *        Capacity Exceeded (0x07). If bit 1 of Options is set to 1 and the
 *        Controller supports the Periodic Advertising ADI Support feature, then
 *        the Controller shall ignore bit 2. If bit 1 of Options is set to 0,
 *        bit 2 is set to 1, and the Controller does not support the Periodic
 *        Advertising ADI Support feature, then the Controller shall return an
 *        error which should use the error code Unsupported Feature or Parameter
 *        Value (0x11). If bit 1 of the Options parameter is set to 1 and the
 *        Controller does not support the

 * @brief The HCI_LE_Connection_CTE_Request_Enable command is used to request

 *        Request procedure (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 5.1.12) on a connection
 *        identified by the Connection_Handle parameter. If the Host issues this
 *        command when the Controller is aware (e.g. through a previous feature
 *        exchange) that the peer device's Link Layer does not support the
 *        Connection CTE Response feature, the Controller shall return the error
 *        code Unsupported Remote Feature / Unsupported LMP Feature (0x1A). If
 *        the Host issues this command when the Controller is aware that the
 *        peer device's Link Layer does not support the requested CTE type, the
 *        Controller should return the error code Unsupported Remote Feature /
 *        Unsupported LMP Feature (0x1A). If Enable is set to 0x00, the
 *        remaining parameters shall be ignored. The CTE_Request_Interval
 *        parameter defines whether the Constant Tone Extension Request
 *        procedure is initiated only once or periodically. In the case of
 *        periodic operation, the procedure is initiated every
 *        CTE_Request_Interval. However, the Controller may delay initiating the
 *        procedure beyond the requested interval (e.g., in order to prioritize
 *        other activities). The Requested_CTE_Length parameter indicates the
 *        minimum length of the Constant Tone Extension and the
 *        Requested_CTE_Type parameter indicates the type of Constant Tone
 *        Extension that the Controller shall request from the remote device. A
 *        request is active on a connection from when the Host issues a
 *        successful command with Enable set to 0x01 until the single procedure
 *        has been performed, the period specified by CTE_Request_Interval has
 *        ended, or a command with Enable set to 0x00 has succeeded, whichever
 *        happens first. If the Host issues this command with Enable set to 0x01
 *        while a request is active for the specified connection, the Controller
 *        shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). Note: The
 *        failed command will not affect the behavior of the Link Layer in
 *        respect of the currently-active request. If the Host issues this
 *        command before issuing the
 *        HCI_LE_Set_Connection_CTE_Receive_Parameters command at least once on
 *        the connection, the Controller shall return the error code Command
 *        Disallowed (0x0C). If the Host issues this command when the receiver
 *        PHY for the connection is not a PHY that allows Constant Tone
 *        Extensions, the Controller shall return the error code Command
 *        Disallowed (0x0C). If the Host sets CTE_Request_Interval to a non-zero
 *        value less than or equal to connSlaveLatency, the Controller shall
 *        return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). If Enable is set to
 *        0x01 and the receiver PHY for the connection changes to a PHY that
 *        does not allow Constant Tone Extensions, then the Controller shall
 *        automatically disable Constant Tone Extension requests as if the Host
 *        had issued this command with Enable set to 0x00. Note: If the PHY

 * @brief The HCI_LE_Set_CIG_Parameters command is used by a Central's Host to
 *        create a CIG and to set the parameters of one or more CISes that are
 *        associated with a CIG in the Controller. The CIG_ID parameter
 *        identifies a CIG. This parameter is allocated by the Central's Host
 *        and passed to the Peripheral's Host through the Link Layers during the
 *        process of creating a CIS. If the CIG_ID does not exist, then the
 *        Controller shall first create a new CIG. Once the CIG is created
 *        (whether through this command or previously), the Controller shall
 *        modify or add CIS configurations in the CIG that is identified by the
 *        CIG_ID and update all the parameters that apply to the CIG. The
 *        SDU_Interval_C_To_P parameter specifies the time interval between the
 *        start of consecutive SDUs from the Central's Host for all the CISes in
 *        the CIG. This parameter shall be ignored for all CISes that are
 *        unidirectional from Peripheral to Central. The SDU_Interval_P_To_C
 *        parameter specifies the time interval between the start of consecutive
 *        SDUs from the Peripheral's Host for all the CISes in the CIG. This
 *        parameter shall be ignored for all CISes that are unidirectional from
 *        Central to Peripheral. The Worst_Case_SCA parameter shall be the
 *        worst-case sleep clock accuracy of all the Peripherals that will
 *        participate in the CIG. The Host should get the sleep clock accuracy
 *        from all the Peripherals before issuing this command. If the Host
 *        cannot get the sleep clock accuracy from all the Peripherals, it shall
 *        set the Worst_Case_SCA parameter to zero. Note: The Worst_Case_SCA
 *        parameter can be used by the Link Layer to better allow for clock
 *        drift when scheduling the CISes in the CIG. For example, if a CIS has
 *        more than two subevents, the Link Layer of the Central can set the
 *        timing of the subevents such that the worst case drift in the
 *        Peripheral's clock will not exceed 2 x Sub_Interval. This prevents the
 *        Peripheral from synchronizing its timing to the wrong subevent
 *        (adjacent subevents cannot be on the same channel). The Packing
 *        parameter indicates the preferred method of arranging subevents of
 *        multiple CISes. The subevents can be arranged in Sequential or
 *        Interleaved arrangement (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.14.2). This
 *        is a recommendation to the Controller which the Controller may ignore.
 *        This parameter shall be ignored when there is only one CIS in the CIG.
 *        The Framing parameter indicates the format of the CIS Data PDUs of the
 *        specified CISes. If the Framing parameter is set to 1 then the CIS
 *        Data PDUs of the specified CISes shall be framed. If the Framing
 *        parameter is set to 0 the CIS Data PDUs of a given CIS may be either
 *        unframed or framed (determined separately for each specified CIS) (see
 *        [Vol 6] Part G, Section 1). The Max_Transport_Latency_C_To_P parameter
 *        contains the maximum transport latency from the Central to the
 *        Peripheral, in milliseconds, as described in [Vol 6] Part G, Section
 *        3.2.1 and [Vol 6] Part G, Section 3.2.2. This parameter shall be
 *        ignored for all CISes that are unidirectional from Peripheral to
 *        Central. The Max_Transport_Latency_P_To_C parameter contains the
 *        maximum transport latency from the Peripheral to the Central, in
 *        milliseconds, as described in [Vol 6] Part G, Section 3.2.1 and [Vol
 *        6] Part G, Section 3.2.2. This parameter shall be ignored for all
 *        CISes that are unidirectional from Central to Peripheral. The
 *        CIS_Count parameter indicates the number of CIS configurations being
 *        modified or added by this command. The Controller shall set the
 *        CIS_Count return parameter equal to this. The CIS_ID[i] parameter
 *        identifies a CIS and is set by the Central's Host and passed to the
 *        Peripheral's Host through the Link Layers during the process of
 *        establishing a CIS. The Max_SDU_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the
 *        maximum size of an SDU from the Central's Host. If the CIS is
 *        unidirectional from Peripheral to Central, this parameter shall be set
 *        to 0. If a CIS configuration that is being modified has a data path
 *        set in the Central to Peripheral direction and the Host has specified
 *        that Max_SDU_C_To_P[i] shall be set to zero, the Controller shall
 *        return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). The Max_SDU_P_To_C[i]
 *        parameter identifies the maximum size of an SDU from the Peripheral's
 *        Host. If the CIS is unidirectional from Central to Peripheral, this
 *        parameter shall be set to 0. If a CIS configuration that is being
 *        modified has a data path set in the Peripheral to Central direction
 *        and the Host has specified that Max_SDU_P_To_C[i] shall be set to
 *        zero, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
 *        (0x0C). The PHY_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies which PHY to use for
 *        transmission from the Central to the Peripheral. The Host shall set at
 *        least one bit in this parameter and the Controller shall pick a PHY
 *        from the bits that are set. The PHY_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies
 *        which PHY to use for transmission from the Peripheral to the Central.
 *        The Host shall set at least one bit in this parameter and the
 *        Controller shall pick a PHY from the bits that are set. The
 *        RTN_C_To_P[i] (Retransmission Number) parameter contains the number of
 *        times that a CIS Data PDU should be retransmitted from the Central to
 *        Peripheral before being acknowledged or flushed (irrespective of which
 *        isochronous events the retransmission opportunities occur in). If the
 *        CIS is unidirectional from Peripheral to Central, this parameter shall
 *        be ignored. Otherwise, this parameter is a recommendation to the
 *        Controller which the Controller may ignore. The RTN_P_To_C[i]
 *        parameter contains the number of times that a CIS Data PDU should be
 *        retransmitted from the Peripheral to Central before being acknowledged
 *        or flushed (irrespective of which isochronous events the
 *        retransmission opportunities occur in). If the CIS is unidirectional
 *        from Central to Peripheral, this parameter shall be ignored.
 *        Otherwise, this parameter is a recommendation to the Controller which
 *        the Controller may ignore. If the Status return parameter is non-zero,
 *        then the state of the CIG and its CIS configurations shall not be
 *        changed by the command. If the CIG did not already exist, it shall not
 *        be created. If the Status return parameter is zero, then the
 *        Controller shall set the Connection_Handle arrayed return parameter to
 *        the connection handle(s) corresponding to the CIS configurations
 *        specified in the CIS_IDs command parameter, in the same order. If the
 *        same CIS_ID is being reconfigured, the same connection handle shall be
 *        returned. The connection handle of a CIS shall refer to the CIS when
 *        it exists and to the configuration of the CIS stored in a CIG when the
 *        CIG exists but the CIS with that CIS_ID does not. If the Host issues
 *        this command when the CIG is not in the configurable state, the
 *        Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). If
 *        the Host attempts to create a CIG or set parameters that exceed the
 *        maximum supported resources in the Controller, the Controller shall
 *        return the error code Memory Capacity Exceeded (0x07). If the Host
 *        attempts to set CIS parameters that exceed the maximum supported
 *        connections in the Controller, the Controller shall return the error
 *        code Connection Limit Exceeded (0x09). If the Host sets, in the
 *        PHY_C_To_P[i] or PHY_P_To_C[i] parameters, a bit for a PHY that the
 *        Controller does not support, including a bit that is reserved for
 *        future use, the Controller shall return the error code Unsupported
 *        Feature or Parameter Value (0x11). If the Controller does not support
 *        asymmetric PHYs and the Host sets PHY_C_To_P[i] to a different value
 *        than PHY_P_To_C[i], the Controller shall return the error code
 *        Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11). If the Host specifies

/**
 * @brief The HCI_LE_Set_CIG_Parameters_Test command should only be used for
 *        testing purposes. The command is used by a Central's Host to create a
 *        CIG and to set the parameters of one or more CISes that are associated
 *        with a CIG in the Controller. The CIG_ID parameter identifies a CIG.
 *        This parameter is allocated by the Central's Host and passed to the

 *        this command or previously), the Controller shall modify or add CIS
 *        configurations in the CIG that is identified by the CIG_ID and update
 *        all the parameters that apply to the CIG. The SDU_Interval_C_To_P
 *        parameter specifies the time interval of periodic SDUs from the
 *        Central's Host. The SDU_Interval_P_To_C parameter specifies the time
 *        interval of periodic SDUs from the Peripheral's Host. The FT_C_To_P
 *        parameter identifies the maximum time for a payload from the Central
 *        to Peripheral to be transmitted and re-transmitted, after which it is
 *        flushed (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.13.5). This parameter is
 *        expressed in multiples of ISO_Interval. The FT_P_To_C parameter
 *        identifies the maximum time for a payload from the Peripheral to
 *        Central to be transmitted and re-transmitted, after which it is
 *        flushed (see[Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.13.5). This parameter is
 *        expressed in multiples of ISO_Interval. The ISO_Interval parameter
 *        specifies the time between two consecutive CIS anchor points. The
 *        CIS_Count parameter contains the number of CIS configurations being
 *        added or modified by this command. The Controller shall set the
 *        CIS_Count return parameter equal to this. The CIS_ID[i] parameter
 *        identifies the CIS and is set by the Central's Host and passed to the
 *        Peripheral's Host through the Link Layers during the process of
 *        establishing a CIS. The Worst_Case_SCA parameter is the worst-case
 *        sleep clock accuracy of all the Peripherals that will participate in
 *        the CIG. The Host should get the sleep clock accuracy from all the
 *        Peripherals before issuing this command. In case the Host cannot get
 *        the sleep clock accuracy from all the Peripherals, it shall set the
 *        Worst_Case_SCA parameter to zero. Note: The Worst_Case_SCA parameter
 *        can be used by the Link Layer to better allow for clock drift when
 *        scheduling the CISes in the CIG. For example, if a CIS has more than
 *        two subevents, the Link Layer of the Central can set the timing of the
 *        subevents such that the worst case drift in the Peripheral's clock
 *        will not exceed 2 x Sub_Interval. This prevents the Peripheral from
 *        synchronizing its timing to the wrong subevent (adjacent subevents
 *        cannot be on the same channel). The Packing parameter is used to
 *        indicate the preferred method of arranging subevents of multiple
 *        CISes. The subevents can be arranged in Sequential or Interleaved
 *        arrangement. This is a recommendation to the Controller which it may
 *        ignore. This parameter shall be ignored when there is only one CIS in
 *        the CIG. The Framing parameter indicates the format of the CIS Data
 *        PDUs of all the CISes. If the Framing parameter is set to 1 then the
 *        CIS Data PDUs of the specified CISes shall be framed, and when set to
 *        0 they shall be unframed (see [Vol 6] Part G, Section 1). The
 *        CIS_ID[i] parameter is used to identify a CIS. The NSE[i] parameter
 *        identifies the maximum number of subevents for each CIS in a CIG
 *        event. The Max_SDU_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the maximum size of
 *        SDU from the Central's Host. If the CIS is unidirectional from
 *        Peripheral to Central, this parameter shall be set to 0. If a CIS
 *        configuration that is being modified has a data path set in the
 *        Central to Peripheral direction and the Host has specified that
 *        Max_SDU_C_To_P[i] shall be set to zero, the Controller shall return
 *        the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). The minimum value of the
 *        Max_SDU_Size parameter in the ISO Transmit Test mode when the
 *        Payload_Type = 1 or 2 shall be 4 octets. The Max_SDU_P_To_C[i]
 *        parameter identifies the maximum size of SDU from the Peripheral's
 *        Host. If the CIS is unidirectional from Central to Peripheral, this
 *        parameter shall be set to 0. If a CIS configuration that is being
 *        modified has a data path set in the Peripheral to Central direction
 *        and the Host has specified that Max_SDU_P_To_C[i] shall be set to
 *        zero, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
 *        (0x0C).The minimum value of the Max_SDU parameter in the ISO Transmit
 *        Test mode when the Payload_Type = 1 or 2 shall be 4 octets. The
 *        Max_PDU_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the maximum size PDU from the
 *        Central to Peripheral. The Max_PDU_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies the
 *        maximum size PDU from the Peripheral to Central. The PHY_C_To_P[i]
 *        parameter identifies the PHY to be used for transmission of packets
 *        from the Central to the Peripheral. The Host shall set only one bit in
 *        this parameter and the Controller shall use the PHY set by the Host.
 *        The PHY_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies the PHY to be used for
 *        transmission of packets from the Peripheral to the Central. The Host
 *        shall set only one bit in this parameter and the Controller shall use
 *        the PHY set by the Host. The BN_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the
 *        burst number for Central to Peripheral (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section
 *        4.5.13). If the CIS is unidirectional from Peripheral to Central, this
 *        parameter shall be set to zero. The BN_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies
 *        the burst number for Peripheral to Central (see [Vol 6] Part B,
 *        Section 4.5.13). If the CIS is unidirectional from Central to
 *        Peripheral, this parameter shall be set to zero. If the Status return
 *        parameter is non-zero, then the state of the CIG and its CIS
 *        configurations shall not be changed by the command. If the CIG did not
 *        already exist, it shall not be created. If the Status return parameter
 *        is zero, then the Controller shall set the Connection_Handle arrayed
 *        return parameter to the connection handle(s) corresponding to the CIS
 *        configurations specified in the CIS_IDs command parameter, in the same
 *        order. If the same CIS_ID is being reconfigured, the same connection
 *        handle shall be returned. If the Host issues this command when the CIG
 *        is not in the configurable state, the Controller shall return the
 *        error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). If the Host attempts to create a
 *        CIG or set parameters that exceed the maximum supported resources in
 *        the Controller, the Controller shall return the error code Memory
 *        Capacity Exceeded (0x07). If the Host attempts to set CIS parameters
 *        that exceed the maximum supported connections in the Controller, the
 *        Controller shall return the error code Connection Limit Exceeded
 *        (0x09). If the Host attempts to set an invalid combination of CIS
 *        parameters, the Controller shall return the error code Unsupported
 *        Feature or Parameter Value (0x11). If the Host sets, in the
 *        PHY_C_To_P[i] or PHY_P_To_C[i] parameters, a bit for a PHY that the
 *        Controller does not support, including a bit that is reserved for
 *        future use, the Controller shall return the error code Unsupported
 *        Feature or Parameter Value (0x11). If the Controller does not support
 *        asymmetric PHYs and the Host sets PHY_C_To_P[i] to a different value

 *        identifies the associated periodic advertising train of the BIG (see
 *        [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.4.5.1). The Num_BIS parameter contains the
 *        total number of BISes in the BIG. The SDU_Interval parameter contains
 *        the time interval of the periodic SDUs. The Max_SDU parameter contains
 *        the maximum size of an SDU. The Max_Transport_Latency parameter is the
 *        maximum transport latency (in milliseconds) as described in [Vol 6]
 *        Part G, Section 3.2.1 and [Vol 6] Part G, Section 3.2.2. This includes

 *        the BIG. The Framing parameter indicates the format for sending BIS
 *        Data PDUs. If the Framing parameter is set to 1 then BIS Data PDUs
 *        shall be Framed and when set to 0 they may be unframed (see [Vol 6]
 *        Part G, Section 1). The Encryption parameter identifies the encryption
 *        mode of the BISes. If the Encryption parameter is set to 1
 *        (encrypted), the Broadcast_Code is used in the encryption of payloads
 *        (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.4.6.10). The Broadcast_Code parameter

 *        existing connection using the Connection Subrate Update procedure. The
 *        Subrate_Min and Subrate_Max parameters specify the range of acceptable
 *        subrating factors being requested. The Max_Latency parameter specifies
 *        the maximum Peripheral latency in units of subrated connection events.
 *        The same maximum shall apply irrespective of the subrating factor
 *        actually chosen. The Continuation_Number parameter specifies the
 *        number of underlying connection intervals to remain active after a
 *        packet (other than an empty packet) is transmitted or received. The
 *        Supervision_Timeout parameter specifies the link supervision timeout
 *        for the connection. The Supervision_Timeout, in milliseconds, shall be
 *        greater than 2 x current connection interval x Subrate_Max x
 *        (Max_Latency + 1). If this command is issued on the Central, the
 *        following rules shall apply when the Controller initiates the
 *        Connection Subrate Update procedure (see Core Vol 6 Part B, Section
 *        5.1.19): * The Peripheral latency shall be less than or equal to
 *        Max_Latency. * The subrate factor shall be between Subrate_Min and
 *        Subrate_Max. * The continuation number shall be equal to the lesser of
 *        Continuation_- Number and (subrate factor - 1). * The connection
 *        supervision timeout shall be equal to Supervision_Timeout. If this
 *        command is issued on the Central, it also sets the acceptable
 *        parameters for requests from the Peripheral (see Core Vol 6 Part B,
 *        Section 5.1.20). The acceptable parameters set by this command
 *        override those provided via the HCI_LE_Set_Default_Subrate command or
 *        any values set by previous uses of this command on the same
 *        connection.  If this command is issued on the Peripheral, the
 *        following rules shall apply when the Controller initiates the
 *        Connection Subrate Request procedure: * The Peripheral latency shall
 *        be less than or equal to Max_Latency. * The minimum and maximum
 *        subrate factors shall be between Subrate_Min and Subrate_Max. * The
 *        continuation number shall be equal to the lesser of
 *        Continuation_Number and (maximum subrate factor - 1). * The connection
 *        supervision timeout shall be equal to Supervision_Timeout. If the
 *        Connection_Handle parameter does not identify a current ACL
 *        connection, the Controller shall return the error code Unknown

 *        the Peripheral's FeatureSet, the Controller shall return the error
 *        code Unsupported Remote Feature (0x1A).
 * @param Connection_Handle Connection handle of the ACL.
 *        Values:
 *        - 0x0000 ... 0x0EFF
 * @param Subrate_Min Minimum subrate factor to be applied to the underlying
 *        connection interval.
 *        Values:
 *        - 0x0001 ... 0x01F4
 * @param Subrate_Max Maximum subrate factor to be applied to the underlying
 *        connection interval.
 *        Values:
 *        - 0x0001 ... 0x01F4
 * @param Max_Latency Maximum Peripheral latency for the connection in units of
 *        subrated connection intervals.
 *        Values:

 * @param Continuation_Number Minimum number of underlying connection events to
 *        remain active after a packet containing a Link Layer PDU with a non-
 *        zero Length field is sent or received.
 *        Values:
 *        - 0x0000 ... 0x01F3
 * @param Supervision_Timeout Supervision timeout for this connection. Time = N
 *        x 10 ms.
 *        Values:
 *        - 0x000A (100 ms)  ... 0x0C80 (32000 ms)
